I wrote a few completely different functions below. These are practice exercises. 

Function 1: I wrote a basic function to write about my activities for the day. 

Function 2: I wrote a function with a parameter that discusses my favorite type of cookie.

Function 3: I wrote a function with two parameters which asked me for my name and occupation.

Function 4: I wrote a function with a conditional block and if statement which asked the user to disclose how many glasses of water they drank today.
